# Data-Analysis-on-Google-Applications
Nowadays, with the ease of access to free information and tools available on the Internet, making mobile applications has never been easier than before. This is accentuated by the ubiquitous number of applications in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. However, our group realise that it has become a problem. Even though many apps are available, most of them do not meet consumer expectations and are there only to clutter out the useful ones from consumers. As such, it would be more troublesome for a customer to find an app that suits his/her needs.  Therefore, this report aims to accomplish the following objectives:     
Identifying important features of an application through the use of WordCloud on reviews of applications    
Analyzing price distributions among apps belonging to the same category which affects pricing decisions     
Drawing correlations between different aspects of an app         
      Price against number of downloads         
      Price against ratings  
In doing so, we hope our analysis will give app developers a clearer idea of what to look out for when developing an app so that we can declutter the app markets while reducing wastage of resources.
